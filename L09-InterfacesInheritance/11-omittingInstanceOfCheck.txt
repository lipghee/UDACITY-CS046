If the instanceof check is removed from scene.java e.g.

            for (Drawable d : elements)
            {  
//                if (d instanceof Moveable)
  //              {
                    Moveable m = (Moveable) d;
                    m.move(1);
    //            }
            }

RESULT:
There is a run time error (note: not compile error) because some drawables cannot be cast to Moveables i.e.

java.lang.ClassCastException:
House cannot be case to Moveable

"if (d instanceof Moveable)" means, I think, each d is checked for "implements Drawable, Moveable" in class definition and house didn't contain this while car and dog did.
